-----------------------------
ttyl: a trip to target that starts out with good intentions and ends up being a spending spree with no end in site other than the store closing

-----------------------------
Scene 1: parking garage
*** we start out inside the parking garage of target, we here cars moving by and the occasional beep of a car locking

*** within the main characters mind we here him thinking:
K - "Alright, I've got a list of things I know I need, and I'm not gonna stray from it whatsoever, you're on a strict budget"

*** we then hear an angel's voice from the right
A - "Thats the spirit Kyle, you're on a budget, you can't go buying a bunch of candles and fancy cheeses like you did last time. Whatever you do don't cave to the target demon over their"

K - "Good thinking Target Angel, I just gotta get in, get out, and get goin"

*** then we here another voice, this time from the left
D - "Yeahhhhhh, fat chance buddy boy. Its september and you know what that means? Its spooky season, and you're gonna buy all the decorations you can fit in your cart"

*** we hear the sound of the sliding doors open as Kyle walks in
K - "No target demon, BEGONE! Today is not the day for halloween shopping, its just a quick, no frills, target run"

D - "yeah suuuuuure it is, we'll see about that"

-----------------------------
Scene 2: Start Shopping
*** Kyle grabs a cart to begin shopping

*** we hear general tagert white noise: checkout beeps, cart wheels, etc.

K - "Alright whats on my list"

K - "ok so I need eggs, hand soap, juice..."

D - "Hey, hey kyle, check out those window clings over in the dollar section. Tjose would look GREAT on your bedroom window"

K - "No damnit, I'm staying on the list"

A - "Yeah, he's staying on the list, you should just give up now"

D - "But Kyle, they are oonnnnly $1, theres no harm in that right?"

K - "I mean, I guess you've got a point, they are only $1 dollar after all"

A - "Kyle no, you told yourself you were going to stay on list this time"

K - "But they look so cute, and theres really no harm in grabbing just ONE extra item, after all its just $1"

D - "Atta boy"

A - *sigh* "Why do I even bother with you"

K - "Oh come on lighten up, from here on out I PROMISE I'll stick to my list"

***we then hear nothing but more target white noise for a couple seconds as Kyle begins to shop around
