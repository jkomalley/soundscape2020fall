So far I have put together my basic parking garage noise for the beginning of the soundscape when I am getting out of my car and walking into target. It still needs some tweaks to get the footsteps sounding right, I may choose to record my actual footsteps when I end up going to target to do some of my field recordings. Also in my project file is a recording I found of supermarket checkout beeps that I could use if I can't get a decent recording from the actual target. Overall, I am starting to get use to the audacity workflow finally so this project has become a little less daunting of a task.
