# 09.15.2020 -- What I Did
  ### I was not able to allocate as much time as I wanted to this weekend to work on this rough draft, so I only have the first half completed. However, I have noticed I am becoming much quicker using audacity. Despite how annoying it maybe I have gotten used to going up and switching between the tools to edit my timeline. I have found that I primarily use the selction tool and the time shift tool.
 ### One of the times we went into our breakout sections a classmate of mine suggested recording my voice while underneath my comforter to blockout unwanted sounds. This ended up working really well in my opinion. The audio for my characters' dialogue sounds very clear and has minimal artifacts or unwanted noises.
 ### Thanks to some youtube videos I was able to figure out how to make my voice soiund like thoughts going on inside my head. I did something similar for the angel and demon voices, but then I also changed the pitch on those voices to make them sound more angel/demon like. I discovered how to do that while I was scavenging around audacity trying to find a way to give those voices just a little bit more distinction, since they are all my voice and it sounded like i was just having a conversation with myself before I did it.
  ### While I still have a little bit more to record, I am happy with the progress I've made and have found this project to be a fun but difficult challenge overall.
